## Feature: Find Food Trucks Near a Location Based on Preferred Food

### Description:
Develop a solution to help the San Francisco team find food trucks near their location and based on their preferred food. The solution should return at least the closest food trucks options based on latitude, longitude, and preferred food.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- The solution should accept input for latitude, longitude, amount of results, and preferred food.
- The solution should return a configurable amount of food truck options near the given location and based on the preferred food ordered by distance.
- The food truck data should be sourced from the San Francisco's open dataset.
- The solution should be implemented using Node.js with NestJS Framework.
- Database technology is open to choose, but it is not required for this POC.

### Additional Information:
- San Francisco's food truck open dataset CSV dump of the latest data: [csv_dump_link](Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit.csv)
- The solution should be read-only and not require any updates.
- No AI tools are allowed for this challenge. Just the [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/)  documentation can be used as a reference.
